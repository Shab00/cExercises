# C Programming Exercises & Learning Journey

This repository tracks my progress as I learn C, working through multiple books and resources. It includes structured exercises, experiments, and starter templates.

## Learning Resources

- **[Head First C](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-c/9781449335649/)**  
  My current primary resource for learning C.
- **[Learn C the Hard Way](https://learncodethehardway.org/c/)**  
  Previously my main bookâ€”I've put it on hold for now, but all my earlier exercises are still included.
- **[c.org](https://www.c.org/)**  
  Supplementary practice and reference.

## Repository Structure

- **cHeadFirst/**  
  Solutions, code, and experiments from *Head First C*.
- **cZedShaw/**  
  Exercises and code from *Learn C the Hard Way* (Zed Shaw).
- **exercises/**  
  (If you have this folder) General exercises, possibly from multiple resources.
- **playGround/**  
  Experimental code, quick tests, and messing around.
- **c-skeleton/**  
  Starter templates and skeleton code for new C projects.
- **Makefile**  
  Basic build system for compiling exercises manually.

## Development Environment

- **Editor:** Vim (building proficiency with Vim keybindings)
- **Build:** Makefile-based, manual compilation per exercise
- **Goal:** Transition to Neovim after *Head First C*

## Motivation

- Explore C fundamentals with minimal tooling
- Work through multiple books for a broader perspective
- Practice editor skills alongside language learning
- Keep a record of experiments, false starts, and personal notes
