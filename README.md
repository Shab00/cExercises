# C Programming Exercises

This repository contains my progress as I work through Zed Shaw's ["Learn C the Hard Way"](https://learncodethehardway.org/c/) book. It serves as a collection of exercises, experiments, and notes from my C learning journey.

## Repository Structure

- **exercises/**: Contains solutions to Zed Shaw's book exercises
- **playground/**: Experimental code and practice from [c.org](https://www.c.org/) and other learning resources

## Development Environment

- Primary editor: Vim (building proficiency with Vim keybindings)
- Build system: Basic Makefile with manual exercise compilation
- Future goal: Transition to Neovim after completing the book

## Motivation

I'm taking a hands-on approach to learning C by:
1. Following Zed Shaw's structured exercises
2. Supplementing with additional practice from c.org
3. Using minimal tooling to focus on fundamentals
4. Gradually improving my editor proficiency
